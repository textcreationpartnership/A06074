            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And vnto this laſt ſort of Men, for certaine reaſons (not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heere to be related) this Worke is but reſeruedly dedicated; I meane ſo far forth only, as they shall vouchſafe to regard it: but principally and directly it is preſented vnto the firſt and ſecond ſortes of men aboue mentioned; that is to ſay, it is directed firſt vnto thoſe vvho be neither Learned, nor yet taken to be ſo, to the end they may be able to knovv ſomevvhat; and next vnto thoſe others vvho be indeed Learned, though they take not themſelues ſo to be; vvho alſo may eſteeme it as preſented to them, to the end they may better their ſuppoſed Knovvledge: For vvhich reſpects I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And ſo much alſo the leſſe, becauſe in Dialogues it is not to be expected, that all vvhich is vvritten, is to be continuate doctrine, but that ſome Interlocutions are to enter betvvixt; the vvhich being paſſed ouer, then the matter of doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:15948:4"/> returneth againe.</p>
            <p>This trace hath <hi>Count Baltazar Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> in his <hi>Courtier,</hi> and <hi>Boetius</hi> in his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> directly follovved; and <hi>Plato</hi> in his Compoſitions more then any other. The vvhich Interlocutions though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may not fall out ſtill to be ſo pleaſing as the doctrine it ſelfe; yet ſo long as they be not vnproportionable to the matter vvhich they concerne, they may be permitted to paſſe: becauſe vvhen all is done, he vvho vvill haue good ſtore of corne, muſt be content vvithall to take ſome chaffe. Yet I cannot vvell deny, but that ſome motions I haue had, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish heere and there ſome diſcourſes of the Interlocutors, had I not conſidered vvithall, that one thing it is to publish a Booke, and another thing to publish but a Pamphlet; and alſo a Booke or Bookes of ſuch particuler titles, as vvithout ſome amplification made, ſome of them doe render of themſelues but ſmall diſcourſe
<pb facs="tcp:15948:4"/> of matter.</p>
            <p>And therfore I haue reſolued to let the Bookes paſſe vvith all, and the very ſame ſpeaches, vvhich the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, haue vpon different occaſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed: becauſe it vvill eaſily be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that Argumentations made by vvord of mouth, cannot ſo cloſely be compacted togeather, as may things more conſiderately ſet dovvne by pen; though I hope it vvill appeare vvithall, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably vnto other English Workes, no vvant of doctrine vvill heare be found.

And other ſome alſo there are, who when they haue it either left them by others, or gotten by their owne induſtry, do not know how to keep it. So that the way vnto <hi>Thrift,</hi> is not only to get, or to haue Wealth gotten, but alſo to know how to gouerne &amp; conſerue it: not couetouſly, aboue the ſtynt of their conuenient need, as diuers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15948:6"/> do; but temperately, proportionatly, and decently: ſince <hi>Thrift</hi> ought to be the meane betwixt Liberality and Auarice, like as Liberality is the meane betwixt Auarice and Prodigality; though yet by errour or falſe interpretation, the one of theſe is ſometimes taken for the other. As the couetous Gameſter, by his continuall looſing, either at Dice or Cardes, may be thought to be prodigall though he be not: And on the other ſide the thriuing Merchant opreſſed at home with children more then he can well prouide for, may be taken to be couetous when he is not: Since, according to the old Saying, <hi>He who hath a daughter to marry, hath need of money; &amp; he likewiſe who hath two daughters to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hath need of more; but he who hath many daughters to marry, hath need of a great deale.</hi> The which to get, ſome do vſe publike violence, and theſe are commonly depriued therof againe (either they, or theirs) by the ſpeciall prouidence of God: and ſome others hauing got their wealth with equity and vpright dealing, do prudently conſerue and ſpend it; and theſe be only they, who may truely be termed <hi>Thrifty.</hi> Vnto which ſort there needeth no more to be ſaid, becauſe they haue the Lawes both of God and Men concurring with them. And therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe other two ſorts of Getters before mentioned, this firſt Booke of the firſt Volume of my Relation, is only intended, who though they pretend to be followers alſo of <hi>Thrift;</hi> yet is it no thriuing to get &amp; conſerue their goods, by ſuch culpable meanes, as aſſuredly reſteth puniſhable, as well by diuine, as by humane Iustice.</p>

               <p>¶ Thou ſhalt therfore vnderſtand, good Reader, that there happened of late to meet togeather in the auncient Citty of <hi>Aquiſgrane,</hi> three men of one nation, and of one language, but of different Prouinces, &amp; of diuers diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The firſt a dexterous Northern-man, who being the conducter of a certaine Gentlemans ſonne of thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and a Politician by profeſſion, was come thither only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15948:7"/> for ſtipend and remuneration of his ſeruice, whome we will cal for the preſent by the name of AQVILONIVS, according to the title of the Climate towards which he was borne. The ſecond was a far borne Weſtern-man, &amp; by profeſſion a Proteſtant, but of the ciuiller ſort, come thither only, as trauellers be wont to do, for curioſity to ſee the place, whome for the like reſpect before alledged, we will call by the name of FAVONIVS. And the laſt a middle dwelling Eſtern-man, who being a Catholike exiled, was come thither only by reaſon of ſicknes, to take in that place the commoditie of the Baynes (more vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Bathes) and him we will call, for the former reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, by the name of SVBSOLANVS. Theſe three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, being wont, at one of their lodgings, to meet togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther often, were fallen one day into a more ſerious debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then at any tyme before. Wherupon my ſelfe (who was Iudged in a chamber of the ſame houſe) hearing them grow ſomewhat lowder then they were wont to be, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to go in vnto them: &amp; euen as I was entring into the chamber, I heard <hi>Aquilonius</hi> ſay theſe very words.</p>

                  <p>It ſeemeth hereby you haue not yet conſidered this other point, that there is not ſcarcely any thing in the world to be found ſo dangerous to be dealt withall, as worldlines it ſelfe, which as ſayth an old Doctour of your owne Schoole, in his booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> leadeth men vnto things that be vaine, hurtfull, full of biting thoughts, perturbations, afflictions, feares, fooliſh delights, diſcords, quarrells, warres, intrapments, wrath, enimity, falſity, flattery, deceipt, ſtealth, rapine, obſtinacy, pride, ambition, enuy, ſlaughters of men, of parents, of friends, of kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, cruelty, malignity, carnalty, bouldnes, vnſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes, violence, pouerty, fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, adultery of all ſorts, and other filthines, which are not fit to be ſpoken of; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, hereſies, periuries, oppreſſions, calumniations, preuarications, falſe teſtimonies, iniuſt Iudgments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, theeuery, and ſuch like. And therefore not without cauſe is it elſewhere ſaid, That the world, with her worldlings, is an aſſembly of wicked men a ſlaughter-houſe of good men, a nouriſher of vice, an oppreſſor of vertue, an enemy of peace, a freind of contention and warre, a ſweet receptacle of wicked men, a bitter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayner of good men, a defender of lies, an inuentor of nouelties, an vnquietnes of ignorant men, a Martyrdome of euill men, a table of glottons, an ouen of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15948:10"/> a <hi>Carybdes</hi> and a <hi>Scylla</hi> of ſuffocating thoughts: Whereupon it is ſaid further by another, that the world doth hate thoſe that do loue it, deceaue thoſe that truſt it, perſecute thoſe that ſerue it, afflict thoſe that eſteeme it, diſhonor thoſe that honor it, &amp; forget thoſe who do moſt of all remember it: Whoſe conuerſation is full of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whoſe myrth full of melancholy, whoſe pleaſure full of remorſe, whoſe conſolation full of ſcruple, and whoſe proſperity is full of feare: Liberall it is in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſcarce in performing, producing many euills; and is the occaſion of many miſerable effects, beginning without any prudence, &amp; ending with bitter repentance. And therfore it is to be beheld a far off, like a monſtrous and rauenous beaſt, leaſt he that commeth too neere it, be deuoured by it. For the more familiar any man is with the world, the more perillous it is: vſing thoſe men worſe who do fauour it, then thoſe who do abhorre it: And to loue it, &amp; not to periſh in it, is a thing impoſſible, becauſe making ſhew of one thing it deceaueth men with another, like as <hi>Iezabel</hi> would haue deceaued <hi>Iehu,</hi> 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 9. ſhewing to him her fine platted head, but ſought to hyde from him her further abhominations: So as many it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth, and many alſo it vtterly blindeth.</p>

We haue now talked ſtanding a good while: let vs therfore take theſe chaires and ſit downe, for that this Conference I doubt me, may continue long. No ceremonies at all, I pray you. In this lodging of myne, you muſt be content to be ruled by me. Take you the patience to ſit heere, and you there: this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more vneaſie ſeate you ſhall giue me leaue to take to my ſelfe.

And becauſe three things do chiefly preſent themſelues to be heere conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, namely the Variety of the World, the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therof, and the Folly of the ſame; therfore the firſt nyne dayes we will treate of Variety; the ſecond nyne dayes of Subordination; and the laſt nyne dayes of the Folly of the world. And ſo to begin firſt with the Variety of the World, becauſe, touching the ſame, there occurre three things to be conſidered, namely Humane Nature, the Mynd of man, and the Body of man (from the which all Variety doth proceed:) therfore as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt branch, we will the firſt three dayes debate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15948:11"/> of <hi>Profit,</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and of <hi>Honour:</hi> the ſecond three dayes we will debate of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and of <hi>Science:</hi> and the laſt three dayes our Conference ſhall be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Education, Trauaile,</hi> and <hi>Repoſe.</hi> And now becauſe <hi>Aquilonius</hi> a little before hath ſo earneſtly asked, who made the world; I my ſelfe will take vpon me this burthen to tel it you, if you will but lend a little patience to heare the ſame. So it is therfore that about the creation of the world, the Poets firſt had two fictions, the one, that it was done by <hi>Demogorgon, Eternity, Chaos,</hi> and <hi>Erebus;</hi> and the other that it was made by <hi>Iupiter, Hebe, Prometheus,</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi> wherof the one is very fooliſh and fond, and the other ridiculous. Alſo the Philoſophers had diuers opinions therof. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of the mynd, that the world was <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> &amp; that conſequently it ſhould endure for euer. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> held, that it was created of inſeparable <hi>Atomi:</hi> And <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that the primitiue matter therof was <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> but that the world it ſelfe had a beginning, though it ſhall haue no end. Finally our Deuins (who teach the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible truth, as well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this point, as other matters of Faith) hold, that the world it ſelfe &amp; the primitiue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therof were both created, and therfore ſubiect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: all I meane ſaue the <hi>Intellectuall ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bodyes</hi> only, the which according to ſome Deuines are eternized by the excellency of their formes, and alſo of the matter that God hath giuen them; yet ſo, as they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be tranſmuted, and purified againe, more then as yet they are. But whether the <hi>Intellectuall,</hi> the <hi>Celeſtiall,</hi> &amp; <hi>Terreſtriall</hi> worlds were all created at once, ſome diuerſity of opinions is found euen amongſt the Deuins themſelues. For S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> S <hi>Thomas,</hi> S. <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctors of the Scholes do generally hould, that there was of them all, but one creation: and this is taken for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15948:11"/> only true opinion. Though otherwiſe out of the doctrine of ſome of the ancient Fathers, ſome thinke it may be probably gathered; that God created firſt the <hi>Intellectuall,</hi> and <hi>Incorporeall</hi> world; that is to ſay, the Angels or Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. Secondly the <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> corporall world, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Spheres</hi> of all the Heauens: and thirdly this <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi> corporall world of ours, and all things therin contayned. Which doctrine may more particulerly be drawne out of S. <hi>Damaſcen, de orthodoxa fide, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. then out of any of the reſt, where he ſaith: that the good, and all good, and excelling good, that is to ſay Almighty God, being Goodnes it ſelfe, would not ſuffer his ſayd Goodnes to remayne ſole in himſelfe, without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therof to others; and therefore created firſt the Angelicall world, next the Celeſtiall, and laſtly the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall world. And according to this ſenſe, ſome alſo do expound the words of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Ghoſpell, the firſt Chapter, where he ſaith, <hi>In mundo erat,</hi> meaning therby the Angelicall world: <hi>Et mundus per ipſum factus eſt,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vnderſtanding the Celeſtiall world, <hi>Et mundus eum non cognouit,</hi> ſpeaking of this Elemental world of ours; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt himſelfe alſo ſpake when he ſaid, <hi>Regnum meum non eſt de hoc mundo.</hi> And heere haue I ſet downe theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning the creation of the world, to the end that the verity of the firſt may be diſtinguiſhed from the curioſity of the ſecond. Now then to deſcend vnto the ſubdiuiſion of this Terreſtriall world, and the contents therof. Firſt it contayneth the ſoule of the ſame, with all the primitiue procreable matters: Secondly it contayneth the foure Elements of Fier, Aire, Water, and Earth, the which are all corruptible, but yet of themſelues perfect and vnmixt: Thirdly the mixed Meteors of Haile, Snow, and the like, the which are imperfect: Fourthly the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15948:12"/> more perfect bodyes of Mettals and Stones, the which are without life: Fiftly the vitall bodyes of Hearbes, Plants, and Trees, the which are without ſenſe: Sixtly the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bodyes of Fiſhes, Foules, and Beaſtes, the which are without Reaſon. And laſtly it conteyneth the vitall, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and alſo reaſonable Creature, to wit Man, whom God hath conſtituted and appoynted to be Lord and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ouer all the reſt.</p>

And ſo we may likewiſe ſay of the vniuerſall World: That though the wild Beaſtes, Cattell, Birdes, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes do inhabite a great part therof; yet both they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and all the reſt is made for the benefit of Man only. And that this to be true, what more manifeſt argument can you haue, then that out of the woods and deſerts the ſtrongeſt Lions, the ſwifteſt Tigers, and the moſt monſtrous Elephantes are taken, and tamed by Men, yea ledde vp and downe the world vnder the obedience and gouerment of Man? Out of the paſtures and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes he draweth to his yoke, the moſt vntamed Bull: and vnto his bridle the moſt fierce Horſe; and vnto his trap the moſt rauening Beare, or Wolfe.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15948:12"/> looſe abroad they obay his voice, and returne againe vnto his lure. And out of the deepeſt ſeas he draweth into his nets innumerable ſorts of fiſhes, yea the Whale himſelfe falleth many tymes to his Prey, though he be ſometimes ſo bigg, as an hundred men may ſtand hewing with their axes the fleſh of his back.</p>

                  <p>Me thinkes in this accompt you reſt deceaued much, ſince of the two, the immodeſt Poore man, who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15948:15"/> by reaſon of his bouldnes can ſhift for himſelfe well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, would ſeeme better able to ſupport his age then may the modeſt Poore man, whoſe ſhamefaſtnes may be an occaſion to make him indure much want. Beſides that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one ſide afflicted with neceſſity, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide with feare of his approaching death, he cannot but paſſe a moſt miſerable age. And therfore I do repute the hauing of wealth, to be a very neceſſary thing, not only for all ſorts of men, but chiefly for old men.</p>

                  <speaker>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet it ſeemeth that in this point you forget your ſelfe greatly, ſince old men be of nature ſo couetous. that when they haue wealth, they be loath to ſpend it: ſo that it were allmoſt as good not to haue it, as to liue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it, and to feele the affliction of pouerty, no leſſe then poore men themſelues do, or rather more then they, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the care and ſolicitude that rich men haue to keep their wealth from being robbed or purloyned from them, which the poore old men be voide of. So that Pouerty and Age would better ſeeme to agree togeather, then age and welthines; &amp; the rather becauſe when the houre of death approacheth, the poorer ſort of men haue leſſe anxiety to leaue their pouerty, then haue the more wealthy to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their riches.</p>

                  <p>You pleaſe me with this point very well, and ſay in effect as I would haue you: for that an old man without money, may be likened to a ſoule without a body. And therfore no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if he deſire euery houre to be rather out of the world then in it: And ſo much the more, becauſe ſuch a poore and needy old man carrieth for the moſt part his eyes in his pocket, his eares in his belly, his teeth in his girdle, and his legges in his hands, which is but a miſerable ſtate to liue in. All which myſeries may in an old man that is welthy be ſupplied, by hauing others to read and write for him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15948:15"/> vſing his ſpectacles: and alſo by hauing others to tell him what a clocke it is, without ayming at his dinner tyme by his hungry ſtomake: Likewiſe to haue others to cut &amp; carue his meate for him without carying about him any knife of his owne: And laſtly by hauing others to beare him abroad either in his chaire or his coach; without vſing the help either of ſtaffe, or crutches: and therfore of the two, yong men might better want the wealth of the world, then old men; though yet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide a yong man without money may in a contrary ſimilitude to that before of an old man, be likened to a body without a ſoule, wiſhing rather in that caſe to haue neuer come into the world, then ſo to liue in it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for ought I can perceaue, it is neceſſary for youth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as for age, to attend alſo vnto Worldlines and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſome by one kind of trade, &amp; ſome by another. And he who hath no trade, nor reuenew to liue by, may v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe the title of a Phiſitian, or elſe of a Lawyet, for that theſe men get money by bare words only, if others do but conceaue an opinion of them, though they haue no skill at all.</p>

                  <p>Your counſell were good, and ſound if it would worke effect in deeds, ſo well as it ſeemeth to do in words: but though an vnskilfull Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may ſometymes get money, by practiſing with men leſſe skilfull then himſelfe; yet how an vnskilfull Lawyer may be able to do the like, I cannot well perceaue: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may happen many tymes to contend with other ſuch Lawers as be skilfull indeed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>This me thinks might be remedied by two or three ways, according as I haue noted, by obſeruing the proceedings of our owne Countrey: to wit, either by a firme, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute boldnes (the which may many tymes put a ſober learned man to ſilence) or elſe by beſtowing ſome part
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15948:16"/> of his owne fees, to get the fauour of the Iudge: or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by making friendſhip with his fellow Lawiers, to fauour one another vnderhand, though they make ſhew to be great aduerſaries.</p>

                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then by meanes of theſe helps an vnskilfull Lawier, you ſuppoſe, might be able well inough to make his Profit by the Law: As if it were no greater a matter, to become a Lawier, then to become a Clarke of a Market, whoſe office it is, whenſoeuer he is called vpon, to ſee due meaſure to be made of Corne.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>And what more I pray you, hath to do the Lawier, then to ſee good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be made of Contracts, by alledging that, and no more which his Clients euidences and teſtimonies haue already made knowne vnto him, without further medling with the Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>This ſeemeth ſtrange vnto me, how a Lawier may ſo quite himſelfe from knowing the Law, who hath for his profit to excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſame; when as it is neceſſary for an ordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that hath but only to obay the Law, to be able after a ſort to know it.</p>

                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>It muſt be (you may ſuppoſe) but a very ſilly knowledg of the Law, that a common Subiect may attaine vnto, and the rather for that the grounds, not only of ſome old forren Lawes abroad, but alſo of ſome newer Lawes vſed in certaine parts of England, be ſo intricate and obſcure, that one Law is contrary to another, and yet both of them houlden for good. As for example concerning old Lawes: The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had a Law, that in the tyme of peace no ſouldiar might ſteale, becauſe he might liue by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall trade: but in the tyme of warre he might ſteale, to prouide both for his preſent need, and alſo for the tyme to come. The <hi>Aegiptians</hi> had a contrary Law, that in time of warre no ſouldiar might ſteale, for not hindring
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15948:16"/> therby his Military diſcipline; but in tyme of peace he might, becauſe he had not then any pay; yet with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhould write his name for a Theefe in the booke of the hygh Prieſt, and preſent vnto him alſo a note of the ſtolne goods, to the end, that if the owner redeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, they might be reſtored him, excepting only the fourth part, which was to remayne to the theefe, as alſo the whole, if it were not redemanded. Were not theſe Lawes, thinke you, one contrary to another?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Contrary they were, and ſo perhaps the people, who made them, were no leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary of nature then their Lawes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſay you then to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had amongſt them an old Law. That euery man ſhould take two wiues, to the end that no man for variety of pleaſure ſhould either keep concubynes, or practiſe with other mens wiues: wheras on the other ſide their Neighbours the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> had a contrary old Law, to wit, That euery woman ſhould take two husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, to the end that one of them ſhould be ſtill at home, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the houſe, while the other was at the warres. Can there any thing be more contrary then theſe?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>FAVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt conſider, that thoſe Lawes were made in tyme of Gentility, and alſo by Cittyes of ſeuerall Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, that were emulators in all things one to another.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>I propound you then another example at home amongſt our ſelues, That in one Lordſhip the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sonne is to be heyre, becauſe he is ſuppoſed beſt able to ſerue his Prince; and in another Lordſhip the yongeſt Sonne is to inherite all, becauſe he is leaſt able to prouide for himſelfe: be not theſe alſo contrary Lawes the one to the other, and yet both of them houlden to be good?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>If both theſe Lawes were in vſe in two diſtinct Lordſhipes houlden alike by Kinghts ſeruice, they might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15948:17"/> import ſome contrariety as you ſay: but your latter caſe, is only for Landes which are houlden in Socage Tenure, according to our Law terme; and not for all ſuch Landes neither, but for the ſmalleſt part therof, and for that part alſo permitted only by the particuler cuſtomes of ſome Mannours, and not ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by the Law; the which Law may be knowne, no doubt, well inough vnto all, or the moſt part of thoſe who haue to obay it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your alledged contradiction.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Let vs then conſider this other reaſon, Whether ordinary ſubiects ſhould be bound ſo ſtrictly to know the Law, when as that which was Law the laſt yeare, may this yeare be no Law at all, by occaſion of ſome new Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made againſt it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then by this accompt, becauſe the laſt yeare there was peace and this yeare warre, the ſubiects ſhould not be bound to know when it is peace, and when warre; not that I will infer hereof, that euery common Subiect ſhould know the Law, ſo exactly and particulerly as Lawiers themſelues, who make their profit of it; but only to know the ſame ſuperficially and in generall: that is to ſay, partly by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and partly by naturall Reaſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then naturall Reaſon by your owne confeſſion is halfe inough of it ſelfe in ſubiects, to make them to know ſo much of the Law as is neceſſary for their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay very well, for ſo much haue I confeſſed already indeed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>But he who doth know any part of the Law by naturall Reaſon, may he not execute by naturall Reaſon ſo much therof in his practiſe as he knoweth?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FAVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>I will not greatly deny, but that naturall Reaſon alone may ſerue well inough the turne to execute all ſorts of priuate Iuſtice, the which extendeth it ſelfe no further
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15948:17"/> then for one Neighbour to render to another his dew, ſo far forth as Humanity, and Charity do oblige him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: But for the practiſe of publike Iuſtice in Courts of Record, there is required the help of more art, according as hath been ſaid before.</p>

                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then by this I perceaue you will now allot vs two ſorts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, wherof the one hath to proceed from the morality of the mynd, and the other from the equity of the Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Not only from the equity of the Law, which conſiſteth in the Reaſon therof; but alſo from the force of the Law, which conſiſteth in the authority of the ſame: the firſt being to be called the Body, and the ſecond the Soule; and both of them tending togeather, to teach as well what is good, as to prohibite what is euil; without which two helps (as ſaith <hi>Plutarke,</hi> in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals) it were hard for vs to inioy the benefits which God hath beſtowed vpon the world. And therfore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe it is ſaid by <hi>Plato,</hi> in the ninth of his Laws, That men without Law, <hi>nihil à feris atrociſsimis diſcreparent.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet I haue heard it ſaid, That thoſe men be better that haue no Lawes at all, then thoſe that haue good Lawes, and do not keep them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe good Lawes vnkept do in ſome ſort extenuate the ordinary Law of Nature; for that with ſuch as haue no written Lawes at all, the Law of Nature is ſeene to be more of force.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>In all places where I haue been the Law of Nature is much extenuated, for that euery where I find good Lawes inough, but very few of them executed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt poore men only: wheras the rich by force of their wealth, do eſcape all penalty; like as the great flies do paſſe through the Cobwebs, but the little ones, not being able, do reſt intrapped.</p>

                  <p>But do
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15948:18"/> you take this to be the fault of the Law, or of thoſe who ſhould better execute the ſame?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Of the executors therof, and not of the Law; for that the Law it ſelfe is always good, and profitable, if it be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accordingly.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>All theſe things being well conſidered, then how may your ignorant Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier, before mentioned, be able by his Ignorance to make any profit to himſelfe, in the practiſe and execution of the Law, without knowing the ſame?</p>

                  <p>Then belike you take the Eſſence of Iuſtice to be made of many mixtures, ſince you impute integrity to be one of them.</p>

                  <p>Whether integrity be her whole Eſſence, or but a part therof, I will not much ſtand vpon it; ſince vnto me it ſhall ſuffice, that ſhe be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyd of paſſion, becauſe the ſame obſcureth the true vnderſtanding of Controuerſies betwixt partie and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <p>Altogeather without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhe cannot well be, for then ſhe ſhould haue in her no anger wherwith to puniſh the wicked, nor yet on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, no affectionate loue, wherewith to incite her to reward the good.</p>

                  <p>By this it would ſeeme to follow, ſince you begin to reckon vp ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, that it were requiſite alſo for her to be ſomewhat ſuſpitious, to the end ſhe may penetrate into the malice of all falſe meaſures and meanings.</p>

                  <p>Your meaning ſeemeth to be good, but your termes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not therewith, ſince the ſame appetite or paſſion, which in men of little wit is called Suſpition, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the wiſer ſort, by the name of Circumſpection; the which of it ſelfe may ſuffice vnto the doing of Iuſtice well inough betwixt party and party; becauſe no Iudge is bound to proceed beyond that which is produced, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Criminall Cauſes only: for that in theſe, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to proceed ſometimes by due coniectures; I meane in cauſes touching life and death, at the leaſt touching the preuention of diuers ſorts of euills, the which might grow too farre, if nothing ſhould be attempted againſt the contriuers therof, vntill the commenced crime might be iuridically proued.</p>

                  <p>If all this be true, that in ciuill cauſes a Iudge hath not to proceed any further by his art, then according to the proofe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and that alſo in Criminall Cauſes he may leaue,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15948:19"/> if he will, all art a ſide, and proceed by coniectures: then as little Law, for the getting of his liuing may ſerue vnto a Iudge, as may haue ſerued our foreſaid practiſing Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier, ſince naturall reaſon alone, is able ſtill in Criminall Cauſes to penetrate far inough by coniecture, as alſo to diſtinguiſh the right from the wronge in Ciuill Cauſes, when ſufficient euidence is giuen on both ſides, and he not to paſſe any further, then according to the ſame.</p>

                  <p>Then any man that hath not meanes to liue by, may counterfait himſelfe for his profit to be of what Trade he will; and ſo by little and little aſcend vnto the higheſt degree of his counterfaite profeſſion.</p>

                  <p>You ſay very well herein, for ſuch is now the practiſe of the world. As for example, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſimple Apothecaries haue aſcended by that meanes to be formall Phiſitians? How many petty Scholemaiſters haue mounted to be preachers in Diuinity, as if they had been Doctours of that art? and how many crafty Scribes in vnder Offices haue growne to be eſtemed for ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Lawiers? and alſo of theſe, how many haue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards become to be Stewards vnto Noble men of their Lands, and ſo by ſitting there as Iudges, to render Iuſtice betwixt partie and partie, perhaps with as little Law in their heads, as they had abſtinence in their hands, from taking of bribes?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then a man that hath no skill in the Law at all, may not only for his profit be a practiſing Lawier, as you haue ſaid, but may now alſo riſe vp to be a certaine kind of Iudge, and ſo to know in that office how to execute Iuſtice.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Albeit you ſpeake this in derogation of that vnskilfull Iudge of myne; yet ſo long as he with the good liking and ſatisfaction of others, can know how to make to himſelfe a ſufficient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of his ſaid profeſſion,

                  <p>So that this Iudge of yours, if he haue ſufficient skill to ſell Iuſtice for money, which is a reproachfull thing, you thinke him for all the reſt, to be able inough to execute that office. As if to know how to make his owne profit, were to know how to execute Iuſtice.</p>

                  <p>Though you ſeeme to make the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iuſtice ſo hard a matter, yet I cannot ſee why ſuch an vnlearned Iudge may not do it very wel, only by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to abſtaine from doing Iniuſtice.</p>

                  <p>This is a new kind of learning, ſcarcely heard of before, and therfore not thought of by many.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not ſo new as you imagine; for it is the doctrine of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who ſaid (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth) that the very abſtayning from doing Iniuſtice, is Iuſtice it ſelfe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>If this were true, as you ſay (that to abſtaine from Iniuſtice, were Iuſtice) then to abſtaine from not committing any fooliſh Act, ſhould be Prudence; and to abſtaine from not doing any temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enterprize, ſhould be Fortitude; and alſo to abſtaine from not eating of poyſon, ſhould be Temperance. But Vertue it ſelfe being otherwiſe agreed vpon by the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, not to conſiſt at all in the leauing of any euill thing vndone, but in the voluntary doing of good things, therfore none of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e former abſtinences in manner and former as they be related, can be truly reckoned for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. As alſo againe, they cannot yet be Vertues, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon; to wit, becauſe whatſoeuer is equally diſtant from payne and reward, cannot be either Vice or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; ſuch I meane, as may be either offenſiue, or helping vnto others. For if it merit not to be puniſhed, it is no ſuch criminall Vice as the Law taketh care of; and on the other ſide, if it merit no reward, it is no ſuch eminent Vertue as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15948:20"/> is had in any eſtimation. For where do you find, that any State or Citty did euer reward any man, becauſe he was a Drunkard? or did euer receaue any one to be a Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen amongſt them, becauſe he was a Glutton? or did euer prefer any man to be an Arbitrator in Controuerſies, becauſe he was a ſluggard? But to the end this may yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto you more plainely, I will propound you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example. The famous <hi>Ariſtid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> a man of great authority but very poore, was ſent by the Senators of that Citty, vnto certaine their Confederate Ilanders, partly to moderate their exceſſe of payments (becauſe they tended to Rebellion) &amp; partly to gather vp certaine old Tributes. This <hi>Ariſtides</hi> hauing by his wiſdome ſet all things in go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d order amongſt them, returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, more poore then he went forth, without hauing benefited himſelfe any thing at all by that office, as many others would haue done. Heere I ſay, if any one ſhould haue gone about to haue perſwaded the Cittizens of <hi>Athen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> did merit to be receaued home with great Triumph and Honour becauſe in executing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice committed vnto his charge, he had not taken, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine his pouerty any vnlawfull bribe at all; would not this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinke you, haue been rather laughed at, then graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Wheras on the other ſide, if it ſhould haue been ſaid vnto them, that <hi>Aristides</hi> did merit to be receaued home with Triumph and Honour for as much as hauing wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moderated the exceſſe of thoſe payments, and reduced downe the old tributes vnto the ability of the people, who were before oppreſſed therby, and that he had ſo preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a generall reuolt of all thoſe miſcontented Ilanders from the confederation of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Heerein this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe; I ſay the fame being thus propounded, the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens could hardly haue thought him vnworthy, either
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15948:21"/> of Triumph, or of ſome other Honour, becauſe by his iuſt operation in that action he had ſtood them in great ſteed, and done them great ſeruice; wheras in the ſame very caſe as it was propounded before, no ſuch Triumph or Honour could well be graunted him, becauſe nothing therein was ſaid to be done by him, worthy of the Honour demaunded, but ſomewhat only left vndone, touching his owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler, which merited no publike remuneration. And therfore for all theſe reaſons put togeather, I may now conclude againſt your former aſſertion, that the not doing of Iniuſtice, is no worke of Iuſtice at all, becauſe Iuſtice conſiſteth not in the leauing of any vniuſt thing vndone, but in the skilfull executing of that which is iuſt.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, if on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide it may be truly ſaid, as all the morall Writers do affirme, that the firſt part of Vertue, is to abſtaine from Vice; why then may it not be ſaid as well, that the firſt part of Iuſtice, is to abſtaine from Iniuſtice?</p>

                  <speaker>SVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe be different manners of ſpeaking, to ſay, that the firſt part of Iuſtice is to abſtaine from Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and to ſay, that to abſtaine from Iniuſtice, is Iuſtice: for though the extremity of one contrary, may be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another; yet they cannot enter the one into the other. As for Example, the extremity of too much Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be the beginning of Seruitude, but yet not part of Seruitude, for that Liberty &amp; Seruitude can haue no affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty togeather, no more then Iuſtice and Iniuſtice; and therfore though a man, altogeather vnlearned, may leaue ſometimes to do Iniuſtice, yet can he hardly be a good Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticer, nor know how to do Iuſtice, without ſpeciall skill in the Law: ſo that the doing of Iuſtice is a thing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moment, then the leauing of Iniuſtice vndone; for that this may be common vnto euery man, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15948:21"/> is but proper vnto Lawiers only.</p>

                  <p>So as your meaning is, that Iuſtice doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in leauing any vniuſt thing vndone, but in doing of that which is iuſt, not according to euery skilfull mans conceipt therof, but as the Law it ſelfe ordaineth, the which ordaineth nothing but that which Iuſtice doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and commaund.</p>

                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay well, and according to my meaning: wherupon it would follow, that if to do that which the Law commaundeth, ſhould be Iuſtice, then the reſiſtance and not doing of that which the Law commaundeth, ſhould be Iniuſtice.</p>

                  <p>I inferre, that as Profit and Diſprofit are merely contraryes, by your owne confeſſion, and yet one and the ſelfe ſame thing may be profitable &amp; diſprofitable; ſo alſo one man may be iuſt and vniuſt, though Iuſtice and Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15948:22"/> be contraries; which Conſequence you ſeemed to deny before, affirming, that if Iuſtice and Iniuſtice were meerly contraries, one man could not be both iuſt and iniuſt.</p>

                  <p>Whatſoeuer I haue ſaid before concerning this point according to the vulgar opinion, that which I wiſhed to be debated, and do now affirme, is, that Iuſtice, and Iniuſtice may be both of them profitable, and diſprofitable. As firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Diſprofit, I ſay, that as well Iuſtice as Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may be diſprofitable to ſuch Iudges, or Magiſtrates, as do runne too apparantly without any artificiall mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, either vnto the one extremity, or the other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become to be either of them poore: the violent Iniuſticer by his infamie, and the violent Iuſticer by his ſcrupuloſity; the one of which cauſes may be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in the perſon of <hi>Hyperbolus,</hi> and the other in the perſon of the allready ſpecified <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> both of them Cittizens of <hi>Athens;</hi> the firſt the iniuſteſt, and the ſecond the iuſteſt of the times they liued in, and acknowledged of all men to be ſuch; who died both of them alike, that is to ſay very poore, and in vtter diſgrace of the people.</p>

                  <p>Touching thoſe two men, I ſhall tell you my mynd, when you ſhall haue made a full end of your narration.</p>

                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>And now on the other ſide, I ſay againe vnto you, that Iuſtice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice may be both of them ſaid to be profitable, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto ſuch kind of Iudges, or Magiſtrates, as do know how to runne a middle courſe betwixt the extremities of Iuſtice and Iniuſtice, wherby ſecretly, and couertly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Profit the one of his Iuſtice, the other of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, they become both of them Rich: the firſt of which cauſes may be exemplified in <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> and the ſecond may be in <hi>Lyſander,</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:15948:23"/> in <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> who knew the way ſo well to runne the middle courſe betwixt ſcrupulous Iuſtice &amp; defamed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, as all of them died very rich, &amp; not only well eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their Cittyes, but famous alſo to the world abroad: which hap befell not in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, neither to <hi>Graccus,</hi> nor yet to <hi>Cato,</hi> notwithſtanding they were reputed of all other, the iuſteſt men of their tyme, who, as I haue ſaid; not knowing how to runne this myddle courſe, died both of them miſerably.</p>

                  <p>You haue here alledged theſe examples in regard of the ſucceſſes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, not as they were indeed: but yet you do not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate aright into the true cauſes of the ſame. For that the Citty of <hi>Athens,</hi> in the tyme of <hi>Hyperbolus,</hi> had great fame for the integrity of Iuſtice practiſed therin, and therfore no meruaile, though ſuch an iniuſt man was there of no reputation; wheras after, in the tyme of <hi>Ariſtides, Athens</hi> was become to be infamous for Iniuſtice according as <hi>Rome</hi> was alſo in the tyme of <hi>Graccus</hi> and <hi>Cato;</hi> and therefore as little meruaile it is, that ſuch iuſt men as they, could not thriue there amongſt them: but when <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> liued in <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> both of theſe Cittyes were neither apparantly iuſt, nor apparantly iniuſt; and therfore for men of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to grow to be great in ſuch Cittyes, as were allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like vnto themſelues, it is alſo no great meruaile: ſo as that artificiall Iuſtice, and Iniuſtice, wherof you haue ſpoken, be not alwayes ſure to proſper, or to paſſe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, if not alſo puniſhed; chiefly if the gouerment vnder which thoſe men do liue, be iuſt and vpright of it ſelfe: and therfore your reaſons before alledged in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of thoſe particulers, be not altogeather ſo firme as you ſuppoſed.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe be no more but diſtinctions of ages and places, when &amp; where Iuſtice
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15948:23"/> and Iniuſtice may be more or leſſe profitable or diſprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but do not therfore diſproue, that Iniuſtice ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may not be profitable, and Iuſtice diſprofitable; nor yet on the other ſide, that Iniuſtice ſometimes may not be diſprofitable, and Iuſtice profitable: I meane at leaſtwiſe vnto ſuch a Iudge, or Magiſtrate, as knoweth how to ſell the ſame for money, which yet it may be, you will alſo reckon togeather with the reſt to be a kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay well, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I do reckon it indeed; but yet to be ſuch a kind of Iniuſtice, as is farre more tolerable then is the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Iuſtice, by the doing of Iniquity and Wrong: and therfore taking Iuſtice to be commodious in the trueſt ſenſe, as when it is executed for Equity, and not for Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in this ſort I ſay, my meaning is not to diſproue at all (as you before would ſeeme to ſuppoſe) that either Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is profitable, or Iniuſtice diſprofitable: but rather the contrary, to wit, that Iniuſtice may be profitable, or Iuſtice any way diſprofitable, either to the publicke, or elſe in particuler.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then all the difficulty reſteth ſtill (I perceaue) touching thoſe two latter points, wherin leauing aſide for a while to ſpeake of diſprofitable Iuſtice, till better place may ſerue for the ſame, I cannot for the reſt but meruaile with my ſelfe, how you haue not yet perceaued out of my former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that Iniuſtice ſometymes may be profitable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt vnderſtand, that I haue perceaued ſo much the leſſe for theſe conſiderations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; becauſe if Iniuſtice may be profitable, it muſt be profitable either to the whole State in general (the which I thinke you will not ſay) or els to the Executor therof in particuler; and this alſo but in ſome reſerued ſort of proceeding only, ſince in Cauſes of publike and apparant
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15948:24"/> Iniquity by your owne confeſſion, it cannot be ſo; vnto which reſerued ſort I do now begin to anſwere you, that though by deceipt of vnderſtanding, ſuch a cunning cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Iudge may ſuppoſe to gaine therby, yet in the end when he commeth to put togeather his reckoning, and to make vp his whole accompt, he will not find it to be ſo.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>What better accompt will you haue him, or can he deſire to make for himſelfe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (I meane according to the preſent ſtate of the world, and his better meanes alſo to be able to withſtand the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries therof) then to find himſelfe prouided therby of all kind of neceſſaryes belonging to the maintenance of his degree and ſtate, the which ſome other of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and trade, either for too much ſcrupuloſity, or els for too little dexterity do many times want.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>So that you would haue him (I perceaue) at one and the very ſame time, to ſerue himſelfe not only of Iniuſtice, but alſo of Iuſtice, vſing the one fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vnderhand for his ſecret gaine, and exteriourly vſing the other for his reputation only, and to colour therby the Iniquity of Iniuſtice.</p>

                  <p>The cuſtome of the world now-a-dayes is come, I can tell you, but vnto little better paſſe.</p>

                  <speaker>SVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>Then all thoſe Iudges, who will not after this manner be vniuſt, may be accompted for ſilly men.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>For ſilly men you may be ſure, and the rather becauſe, by the art and authority of the ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt ſort of Iudges, the Iuſtice of the Iuſt is many times reputed to be counterfait, and ſuborned Iniuſtice.</p>

                  <p>Our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being heere to ſpeake of Profit, I cannot alledge you any Art that may be more profitable; and that profitable Artes are not to be neglected, is not my thinking alone, but the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> (in the eight of his Lawes) who ſaith, <hi>Omnes complectuntur artes ex quibus lucrum conſequi poteſt.</hi>

                  <p>Though <hi>Plato</hi> ſignifyed in thoſe words that men be prone to imbrace any profitable Art; yet meant he not that all profitable Artes, are to be imbraced (but only ſuch as are lawfull) and leaſt of all any Art that tendeth to the corruption of publicke Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as it euidently appeareth throughout all his Workes, and eſpecially in his Bookes <hi>de Republica,</hi> and of his Lawes, wherin all his doctrine tendeth to nothing els, but to frame a moſt happy Common Wealth by the adminiſtration of ſincere Iuſtice: and therfore he ſpecially endeauoreth to make moſt iuſt and vertuous Magiſtrates.</p>

                  <p>He ſaith not this to incite men to the practiſe of all kind of Profit, but only to ſhew the imbecillity of man, deſirous of that which impayreth his Condition; &amp; that Profit and Wealth do ſo, we may gather by the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> in the third of his <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi> where he ſaith; <hi>Lucrum facit homines detetiores:</hi> the which is confirmed by <hi>Deip. apud Volat.</hi> where he alſo ſaith; <hi>Niſi lucrum eſſet, nemo fuiſſet improbus:</hi> and all this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15948:25"/> the rather, becauſe (as ſaith another moderne Writer) <hi>Wealth is a great nouriſher of Vice, and Pouerty of Vertue.</hi> And albeit this were not ſo, yet the too much deſire of Profit is the rather to be bridled, becauſe though the manner of gayning may be neuer ſo honeſt: yet ſaith <hi>Seneca (Epiſt.</hi> 95.) <hi>Lucrum ſine damno alterius fieri non poteſt.</hi> And ſo much alſo the more, when Iniuſtice it ſelfe is fraudulently vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for cauſe of lucre: <hi>Nam tale turpe lucrum accuſatio natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae eſt,</hi> as we read <hi>apud Strobaeum.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15948:29"/> ſtill vnto the greater obloquy of the forſaid Incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt: therfore ſee now what little cauſe you had to bring in him for an example to approue the like vſed in England againſt the Queenes Maieſty of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when ſhe was not taken Priſoner by any Law of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as theſe other Princes were, but comming into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland of her owne accord, yea and inuited, was retayned there by force: and therfore put the caſe, that ſhe had conſpired againſt the Queene of <hi>England</hi> and her State (as ſhe was charged to haue done) ſhe did no more then ſhe might lawfully do, to redeeme her owne vniuſt vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to procure her liberty wherof ſhe was moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly depriued. For which reſpects her condemnation was, as I haue ſaid, moſt incongruous; and ſo much the more for that ſhe was a Woman, a Widdow, the neareſt Ally vnto the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> an inuited Gueſt, an Exile out of her Kingdome, and fled into <hi>England</hi> for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; and finally in ſuch a ſtate, that our State could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no lawfull cauſe of feare: for that being indurance ſhe could neither attempt any thing of her ſelfe, nor yet practiſe with any others further then the State of <hi>England</hi> would permit and wincke at. And therfore by doing as they did, they derogated from the Lawes of Nature, of Charity, of Iuriſdiction and Maieſty, of Parentage, of Hoſpitality, of Protection, and finally from the Law of Nations, and conſequently from humaine Intelligence and reaſon.

                  <p>Well then, I will propound vnto you yet this other, of one who taking with him his Neighbour, did hide vnder the ground an hundred Crownes, which money his nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbour hauing need of, conuayed ſecretly from thence, leauing in the place a bagg of ſtones?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be he had an intention to vſe the money a whyle, and to returne it to the ſame place againe.</p>

                  <speaker>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>He retorned it indeed, though he had no ſuch intention when he tooke it: for the owner therof ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing miſſed it, and ſuſpecting that his neighbour had taken it, told him that the day following he would hide another hundred Crownes in the ſame place; wherupon his neighbour thinking to get the ſame alſo, carried backe the firſt hundred Crownes, and therby loſt the ſame.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>The more I reflect on the matter, the more I diſallow it, becauſe he betrayed the confidence which was repoſed in him, without any conſtraint of neceſſity.</p>

                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſay you then to two companions, who carryed a hundred Crownes to a rich old Vſurer to keep, taking an obligation of him, that he ſhould not deliuer it vnto either of them, vnleſſe they came both togeather for it: after which it paſſed not long but that one of them, by the conſent of his fellow put on a ſute of mourning apparrell, and pretending to the Vſurer that his companion was dead, got the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes out of his handes: and ſhortly after, the other appearing, he obtayned ſentence againſt the Vſurer
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15948:36"/> by vertue of his ſaid obligation, for another hundred Crownes.</p>

                  <speaker>FAVONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>But yet the Vſurer bethinking him better of the matter, cauſed the ſentence to be reuoked againe by alledging to the Iudge the words of his obligation, that he was not bound to repay the money, vnleſſe both of them togeather came for it, wherwith the ſute ended, for ſuch reaſon as you may coniecture.</p>

                  <p>Nor alwayes vnto good men neither, becauſe we ſee by experience, that vnto ſome good men riches do them hurt, by inciting them to Vice, and drawing them from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15948:41"/> Vertue, though the riches themſelues be neither vertuous, nor vicious; and therfore not euill things only, but things which be indifferent, and which in apparence be good, may alſo do harme, and ſometimes more harme then the things themſelues which be apparantly euill. And hereof it commeth, that a man may more eaſily let other mens goods alone, then vſe his owne well, becauſe on the one he knoweth that he cannot intrude without offence, but with the other he thinketh he may be more bold, to do with it what he will, without rendring any accompt for the ſame. And therfore it is no ſafety for a man to loue his owne riches too well, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo iuſtly gotten, leaſt thereby he be induced, not only to be couetous of that he hath, but to loue thoſe other alſo which may be gotten with fraude, becauſe his too much feruent loue and deſire therof may blind his iudgment ſo much therin, as to make him thinke, at leaſt, that to be lawfull which is not.</p>

                  <p>She hath prouided them to this end, for men to take therof ſo much only as is ſufficient to prouide for their ſtates, and profeſſions without ſuperfluity: for as the Moone doth neuer eclipſe, but when ſhe is at the Full: ſo the mynd is neuer ſo much obſcured, as it is with the ſuperfluity of riches. And againe, as the Moone is then furtheſt off from the Sunne which giueth it light when it is at the Full; ſo a man when he is fulleſt of riches, is furtheſt off from that equity and iuſtice, which ought to giue him light in all his proceedings: and therefore he might do well herein to imitate that wary Fly, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not her feet into the great maſſe of Hony, but only taketh with her tongue, ſo much therof as ſerueth her

                  <p>Where, I pray you, was that couetous Wiſdome, you ſpeake of, at the very firſt beginning of things, when there was not yet in the world any kind of money, or riches to be found at all, but that ech where one commodity was changed for another? Belike the man of thoſe dayes, if wiſedome, as you ſay, had chiefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in riches, were all fooles, and yet ſome Wiſe men haue ſaid, That happy, and moſt happy were they, who liued in that ſo ſimple and honeſt an age, while no vanityes were as yet diſcouered amongſt men, nor any diſordinate appetites obſcured the light of the vnderſtanding, with the temptations of the fraile and deceiuable ſenſes, and while there were as yet no weapons, nor warres, nor locks, nor doores, no robbing, nor ſtealing, nor any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temptations vnto any kind of wickednes. For though women and men did conuerſe togeather no leſſe then they do now, yet the women were modeſt and ſhamefaſt, and the men myld, and both of them continent, being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to mortify and ſuppreſſe the diſobedience of the fleſh, partly with abſtinence, and partly with aſſiduous labour, ſo as they felt no great motiues vnto ſinne: I meane that innocent and pacificall age, when no Mettall was as yet digged out of the earth, nor no oxe, nor horſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied to till the ground, but that euery one liued of that which the earth it ſelfe of it owne accord brought forth, without the help of any induſtry or art; for ſo God of his bounty had ordayned, that all thoſe things, wherof man had need, as fleſh, fruites, and the like, ſhould be prouided for him, &amp; produced for his vſe aboue the gound, hyding
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15948:43"/> and burying all thoſe other things which were ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (as gold, ſiluer, and the reſt) within the bowells of the earth it ſelfe, to the end he ſhould neither loue them nor deſire them, nor be tempted to vſe them, in reſpect of the great harme he might receiue by them. Beſides that, no timbred Oake, nor Firre, nor Pyne had then byn fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into ſhips, to furrow the windy ſeas, either for curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to paſſe from one Country to another, or els to fetch home the variety of forrayne vnknowne delicacyes; the which art of nauigating, whoſoeuer firſt found out (were it either the <hi>Sorians,</hi> or the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> or els <hi>Iaſon</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> and his Confederates) certaine it is, that no other occaſion moued them therunto, but meere auarice only, wherof hath enſued both rapines, violences, deaths, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and great diſperſions of people. For if Nauigation had neuer been found out, the King of <hi>Colchos</hi> had neuer byn depriued of his golden Fleece, togeather with the death of his Sonne, &amp; the rapine of his daughter; nor the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Troy</hi> had neuer by the Greeks byn deſtroyed, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Priamus</hi> the King therof, and all his poſterity; nor <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelfe had neuer byn ſo deſolated, as it was, by the great nauy of <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Moreouer in that age no paper, nor pen was yet in vſe, wherewith to write any Statutes, or Decrees, vntill the time that <hi>Minos</hi> gaue Lawes to the <hi>Candians, Lucurgus</hi> to the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Solon</hi> to the <hi>Athenians, Triſmegiſtus</hi> to the <hi>Thebans, Phido</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Caronda</hi> to the <hi>Carthaginians, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to the <hi>Romans:</hi> for before thoſe times men liued vnder thoſe happy, and pleaſant conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which Nature her ſelfe had planted in their breaſts, full of ſincerity, full of meekenes, and full of all other pacificall conſolation, as well mentall, as corporal. Therfore now to anſwere to your former allegation,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15948:44"/> that rich men are the wiſeſt men, ſhould theſe other men who were ſo happy for all things els, be therfore ſaid to be fooles, becauſe they chiefly wanted the vſe of money, and therby the deſire to poſſeſſe the ſame too greedily, as you would haue that wiſe man of yours to do?</p>

Theſe be the braue examples of the neglectors and deſpiſers of riches, to haue greatly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, if not vtterly vndone, their poſterity thereby; contrary vnto that which we read of <hi>Pallas,</hi> of <hi>Calliſtus,</hi> and of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> the infranchiſed ſlaues to <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, who left behind them diuers millions of Crownes; as alſo amongſt the Philoſophers, we read of <hi>Cicero,</hi> of <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> and of <hi>Seneca</hi> to haue riſen from little to be men of great riches: and likewiſe amongſt the ſouldiers we read of <hi>Caius Marius, Lucius Sylla,</hi> and of <hi>Ventidius Baſſus,</hi> who by their owne induſtryes roſe vp vnto infinite wealth, and their poſterity after them vnto great fame and glory; where on the other ſide, what in this world can be more reproachfull then pouerty, or a greater enemy vnto all kind of vertue, either in women or men? As for example, in women what more vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a Guardian may there be found of their chaſtity (and conſequently of all that is good in them) then is want and neceſſity, when as the vnmarried be eaſily drawne thereby vnto all ſorts of laſciuiouſnes, for fupply of their need, and the married be drawne no leſſe to make like ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uock of their honeſty? And in the ſame fort touching the ſtate of men, what ſo much doth abaſe them, or maketh abiect and vile their mynds, not only in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, but alſo in the opinion of others, as doth the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Pouerty: for (ſo ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 9.) <hi>That the wiſedome of the poore is deſpiſed.</hi> And againe (Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. cap. 40) <hi>That it were better to be dead, then to liue in want and need;</hi> adding withall in his Prouerbes; <hi>That all the dayes of a poore mans life, be nothing els but miſery.</hi> Beſides that, what alſo may be vnto gratuity a greater enemy then the ſame? What vnto ſhamefaſtnes, <hi>Cùm non bene conueniunt, nec in vna ſede morantur pudor &amp; egeſtas?</hi> And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15948:47"/> what vnto the obſeruation of all ſorts of Laws, both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and diuine, vnto the which neceſſity beareth no reſpect at all? So that not without cauſe is Pouerty called the greateſt enemy vnto man, the companion vnto all kind of Vice, and of all other euills the extreameſt, yea worſe then either ſickenes, or impriſonment: for that vnto him who is wealthy, there be remedyes inough to be applyed for the one, and conſolations inough to be found for the other; and therfore though you in words do ſeeme to fauour pouerty neuer ſo much, yet I ſuppoſe for the putting of it in practiſe, you will ſtriue againſt it, no leſſe then any other.</p>

                  <p>To ſtriue againſt Pouerty, we are not expreſly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, further then neceſſity requireth, nor yet prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo long as men get riches without the violating of Iuſtice, the which is vnderſtood to be violated, not only by fraude, or force, as hath byn ſaid before; but partly by not reſtoring that which is borrowed, and partly by not rendring at the day that which is hired, and likewiſe by not abſtayning to weare out things left vs in cuſtody and truſt. And as none of theſe iniuſtices are to be vſed for the reliefe of pouerty, ſo alſo much leſſe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of wealth, ſince the ſuperfluity therof is not, as you ſuppoſe, a ſhunner of vice, but an enemy to vertue, as hath byn told you already, making men ſo idle, ſo ſlouthfull, and ſo laſciuious, as they become altogeather effeminate, neither giuen to the practiſe of Armes, nor yet to the ſtudy of letters. And therfore <hi>Democritus</hi> iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the aboundance of riches to be fooliſh, <hi>Heraclitus</hi> iudged it to be miſerable, and <hi>Crates</hi> iudged it to be fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and burdenſome, for which reſpect he threw his Wealth into the ſea; though no kind of wealth be ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome as that, which being wrongfully gotten, doth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15948:47"/> ſeldome tymes deſcend vnto the third generation, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the burden of honeſt pouerty cannot be ſo heauy to beare by much, as the burden of a rich mans culpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For what els doth take away either the innocency from the body, or the life from the ſoule, but the infection of ſinne? So that ſinne alone is more hurtfull vnto man then can be the hurt of all the world beſides, or of Hell it ſelfe. For what draue the Angells out of Heauen (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.) and Adam out of Paradiſe (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.) or the great Floud into the world (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.) but ſinne? Or what els ouerthrew the great Tower of <hi>Babylon (Gen.</hi> 11.) or deſtroyed <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec,</hi> and the Gyants (<hi>Exod.</hi> 17.) or cauſed to be cut in peeces the great army of <hi>Senacherib</hi> (4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.) but ſinne? not to ſpeake of the burning of fiue Cittyes (<hi>Gen.</hi> 19.) or of the perſecuting of <hi>Aegipt</hi> with the ſeauen plagues (<hi>Gen.</hi> 41.) or of the drowning of <hi>Pharao</hi> in the red ſea (<hi>Exod.</hi> 14.) And finally (to omit all other examples ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne) what are all the miſeryes, calamityes, &amp; afflictions that fall vpon men, but puniſhments for ſinne? And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that aboundance of riches is a ſpeciall motiue, and cauſe of ſinne (as I haue declared before) it is euident that rich men are in a dangerous ſtate; in which reſpect our Sauiour himſelfe affirmeth, That it is as hard for a rich man to enter into Heauen, as a Camel to paſſe through a needles eye: wheras poore men on the other ſide, are in farre greater ſecurity, if they be good men withall: for they do ſtill receaue comfort from God in all their diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be they neuer ſo great, and do neuer want neceſſaryes. For ſo God releiued the pouerty of <hi>Agar</hi> by an Angell (<hi>Gen.</hi> 16.) the diſtreſſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his people in the deſert. (2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.) the miſery of <hi>Noemi</hi> by <hi>Ruth</hi> the wife of <hi>Booz. (Ruth.</hi> 2.) and the pouerty of <hi>Elias</hi> by an Angell (3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 29.) beſides the like done vpon diuers occaſions
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15948:48"/> to the Apoſtles themſelues (<hi>Act.</hi> 5.12.27.) and to innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other good men in all ages, wherof infinit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might be alledged. Furthermore the poore man who being confident of Gods mercifull prouidence, is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that which God giueth him, wanteth nothing, hauing all that he will haue, becauſe in not willing that which is ſuperfluous, he hath whatſoeuer he deſireth, and therfore he alone may be ſaid to be poore, who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that which he hath, and deſireth ſuperfluityes. And on the other ſide, only he may be ſaid to be rich, who hath no need nor want of any thing, more then is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and who deſireth not that which he hath not, but only ſo much as he muſt needs vſe, and may alſo conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently haue: ſo as it is not the aboundance of wealth that maketh a man rich, but the contented mynd; nor the want of wealth that maketh a poore man, but the mynd affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for that which is wanting. And therfore to be rich with deſire of increaſe, is to be poore, and to be poore without deſire of more, is to be rich: the which is another accompt then the world doth vſe to make either of the one or the other, reputing him to be poore who hath but little, though he be content therewith, and him to be rich who hath a great deale, though he liue beſides it, and neuer thinkes he hath inough. And theſe kind of rich men be inferiour far vnto that other ſort of poore men, both in life, in death, and alſo after death: in life, I meane, becauſe the poore man enioyeth more his liberty, both to go where he will, and to ſpeake what he will, without any great heed taken vnto him; alſo ſuffereth more eaſily miſeryes, as one who is more accuſtomed to beare them, and taketh more pleaſure in any recreation, as one not ſo wonted to haue them. Likewiſe the rich man is inferiour to the poore man in reſpect of his death, becauſe no body conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15948:48"/> or deſireth his end, for that nothing is to fall vnto them by the ſame; neither hath he himſelfe when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth any burden to diſquiet his mynd, for that he hath not any accompts with the world to make, neither is he ſo loath to leaue the world; as the rich man is, to whom not only the houre of death, but alſo the very remembrance therof is moſt bitter, as teſtifieth the holy Scripture, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>O mors, quàm amara eſt memoria tui homini habenti pacem in ſubſtantijs ſuis!</hi> Moreouer to ſhew that the rich man is likewiſe inferiour to the poore man after his death, there ſhall need heere no other proofe, then that which Chriſt himſelfe hath ſaid therof (<hi>Luc.</hi> 6.) <hi>Bleſſed are you that be poore, for yours is the Kingdome of heauen.</hi> And againe; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable are you rich men, who in your riches haue all your conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> So that the rich man hath his glory here on earth and the poore man hath his in heauen; and therfore God ordayned in the old Law (<hi>Deuter.</hi> 10.) <hi>That the Leuites who were choſen for the Altar, and for his owne ſeruice, ſhould haue no poſſeſsions:</hi> and in the new Law the Apoſtle teſtifieth (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.) that <hi>Pauperes elegit Deus ad hereditatem regni cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le is:</hi> yea our Sauiour Chriſt did not only liue in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelfe, and chooſe poore diſciples, but alſo did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and counſell a young rich man, to ſell all that he had, and giue it to the poore: So that pouerty, although it be moſt where abhorred, yet is it a great, and an ineſtimable treaſure, in reſpect both of the world to come, and alſo of this life, as being the mother of tranquillity, the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of diſquietnes, the Port of contentment and reſt, a ſufferance without loſſe, a paſſion without ſtrife, and the high way to eternall happines in heauen, ſo that it be ſought and willingly ſuffered for the loue of God.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15948:49"/> which is a great ſigne that there is ſomething in pouerty more contrary to nature, then there is in riches.</p>

                  <p>As contrary as they are, it cannot be denyed, but that Diſprofit goeth before Profit, and ſpending before getting; the Plowman muſt ſpend in tilling his ground, before he can reape any fruit; the Artizan muſt lay out in buying of wares to worke vpon, before he can receiue any gaine; and the Merchant at ſea muſt put in venter to looſe all, before he can come to ſee his owne againe. Alſo the Suitor at Law ſpendeth much in following of his ſuite, before he can come to haue any iudgment on his ſide; the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning Courtier giueth firſt many Preſents, before he can get any reward in recompence; and the buyer of Land layeth out more money in one hower, then he is to ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in twenty yeares after. Likewiſe the makers of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per muſt buy many rags, before their paper can be made; the Printers of bookes muſt buy paper, before their books can be ſold; and the ſtudents of Sciences muſt buy many bookes, before they can make any profit of their ſtudyes; wherby it appeareth that Diſprofit many times is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of Profit.</p>

                  <p>So as by this meanes you will inferre, that if you take away pouerty, you take away riches; and if you take away Diſprofit, you take away Profit.</p>

                  <p>You
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15948:49"/> ſay well, ſince for as much as belongeth to the firſt part of your propoſition, I do aske you, What delight a rich man might hope to find in his riches, if ſo there were no poore man to do his labours for him? As for example, to till his ground, to keep his horſes, to go to the market, to dreſſe his meat, to fetch home his wood, to playſter his walls, and the like; all which ſeruile offices, and many other worſe then theſe, if he ſhould be driuen to do them himſelfe, his wealth might lye by him, and ſtand him in little ſteed: ſo as though by taking away pouerty, you do not actually take away the meanes vnto the getting, and increaſing of riches (which may ſometimes be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo obtayned, then by induſtrious pouerty) yet in effect you ſhould bring therby the rich man to be (for want of Drudges to ſerue him) in little better caſe then the poore man himſelfe; which poore man, by doing but only thoſe labours for his owne proper vſe, which he is now hired to do for the rich man, and the rich man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forced to do thoſe labours for himſelfe, which now the poore man doth for him for his money, he would be of the two, in worſe caſe, by being leſſe able then the rich man to take ſuch paynes; and therfore the poore man, if he will, may better liue like a poore man, without the help of the rich man, then the rich man may liue like a rich man, without the help of the poore man.</p>

So that vertue, iuſtice, honeſty, and lawfull Profit go allwayes linked inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly togeather; the Profit being directed by iuſtice, and honeſty, and both theſe by vertue. Furthermore what ſufficient excuſe or pretence can there be for fraudulent dealing, when Nature her ſelfe hath prouided ſufficient and lawfull meanes for the reliefe of pouerty, to wit, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt induſtry, and frugall parſimony, two ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and alſo familiar kinds of helps, as few men be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from them, at leaſtwiſe, for the ſupply of ſo much as is needfull.

                  <p>Thoſe ſome belike you meane to be either theſe, or ſuch like; As for example, to be afflicted with an vnruly, or diſloyall wife, a diſgracious or vnthrifty heire, a defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or diſhoneſt generation of daughters, or which is a more noyſome euill, an vnplacable nature of his owne, either ſtirred vp with drinke, whereby he allwayes ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, or ouerheated with choller, whereby continually he ſtriketh, or els oppreſſed with ſuſpition, whereby he neuer leaueth to torment both himſelfe and others, and ſo enioyeth no pleaſure or contentment of any thing he poſſeſſeth; or if any little contentment he find, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly more when he is abroad, then in his owne houſe, albeit abroad alſo the reproachfull encounters of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diſhoneſt proceedings, cannot but much diminiſh the ſame, not ſuffering ſuch a polluted perſon to looke vpon good men with a right eye, nor to talke with them willingly, but caſting downe his head to fly and ſhunne their company, for feare leaſt any thing might eſcape his mouth to his owne condemnation; the which vigilancy of his, yet ſerueth him to little purpoſe, for that in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſleep he many tymes bewrayeth his fouleſt faults, the which is an vſuall puniſhment that followeth ech where a guilty conſcience, declaring thereby what a terrour it is to liue in ſuch a ſtate, as neither waking nor ſleeping, he taketh any quiet conſolation or repoſe, but is alwayes tormented with the terrour of his owne wickedneſſe. But admit that his impudency may ſomewhat ouercome this defect, and that either in ſenſuality of life, or ſcurrilous
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15948:56"/> actions, or other corrupt behauiour, he may happen to find any more contentment abroad then at home; yet is it ſtill accompanied with little reputation, and alſo in effect no more pleaſure then the wicked poorer ſort of men doe likewiſe find; and ſo his eſtate, by this accompt, is but little better then the eſtate of him that poſſeſſeth much leſſe, if it be not rather much worſe, by how much the care of keeping his ill gotten wealth tormenteth him more. And therfore let the euill rich man either ſtay at home, or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad where he will, let him gather wealth, or purchaſe reuenewes, let him build very ſtately, or feed very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, yea let him fill his Wardrobe with rich apparell, his chambers with precious ornaments, his cheſts with plate, his compt-bookes with debts, his ſtable with horſes, and his houſe with neuer ſo many ſeruants; yet ſhall he neuer be able to rid his heart of griefe, his breaſt of feare, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of ſhame, his conferences of reproach, his ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of diſtractions, nor his conſcience of continuall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting remorſe, then the which there can be no greater ſignes and tokens to be had of a moſt lamentable and miſerable ſtate: the which is ſo much alſo the fuller of torment, and affliction, by reaſon of his alwayes moſt vnſatiable and greedy mynd of hauing and getting, neuer contented or ſatisfied with that he poſſeſſeth, but the more he heapeth and boardeth vp, the more he ſtill deſireth; and all this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his greater affliction, ſeruitude, and ſlauery, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereby himſelfe more thrall then before, either vnto the tempeſtuous variety of ſickle fortune, or of filthy vice, if not of both, the which may be ſaid to ſtriue, as it were, whether ſhall be able to torment him moſt, or to make him moſt miſerable, by reaſon of his bondage and ſubiection alike vnto either; albeit fortune without vice, cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict much, be ſhe neuer of her ſelfe ſo contrary: but where
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15948:56"/> they accord to aſſault on both ſides togeather, there is no vnhappines of ſtate to be compared vnto it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the party to the ſhew of the world do ſtill maintaine a ſtately port, and be continually accompted by the vulgar ſort, to be the happieſt man of his nation. And therfore I may conclude, that as the Scorpion hath in her the remedy of her owne poyſon; ſo the euill man carrieth alwayes with him the puniſhment of his owne wickednes, the which doth neuer leaue to torment and afflict his mynd, both ſleeping and waking, according as it happened to <hi>Appollidorus,</hi> to <hi>Hyparchus,</hi> to <hi>Pauſanius,</hi> and many others whome <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentioneth. For where there concurre togeather (as with the rich peruerſer ſort of men it is commonly ſeene to do) deſire of vnlawfull gaine, of vnlawfull pleaſure, of implacable hatred, and of vnlawfull reuenge; there without doubt concurreth a great deale of hidden infelicity: &amp; which is worſt of all, when the peruerſe rich man hapneth by any mutation of fortune, to want of his accuſtomed wealth, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of his frequent iniquityes, then his vnruly deſires neuer leaue to exclaime and cry out vpon him, till they bring him in the end to commit ſome fouler outrages, then euer before; as for example to ſteale, to take by force, yea and to violate the very Temples themſelues, or otherwiſe to be tormented ſtill with inceſſant ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and dolours. Iudge therfore now vnto what a happy and pleaſant end your forſaid deceiuer of men, for his owne commodity, may be like to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dye, beſides all his other perturbations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions ſpoken of before, being counter-poyſes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to weigh downe all the ſuppoſed and miſtaken fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which you haue already attributed vnto him.</p>

                  <p>Then wealth being annexed to the ſtate of a good poore man, will make him, you imagine, more

                  <p>If then an euill man may apply his wealth euilly, it would ſeeme that wealth of it ſelfe is not abſolutly good.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>How can it but be abſolutly good, when as it is one of the principall inſtruments vnto the exerciſe of vertue, as of Magnificence, Liberality, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, and the like?</p>

                  <p>So is it likewiſe one of the principall inſtruments vnto the exerciſe of Vice, as of Arrogancy, Inſolency, Reuenge, and the reſt.</p>

                  <p>Theſe effects you ſpeake of, do not conſiſt in the Wealth, but in the euill man, that doth euilly vſe it.</p>

                  <speaker>SVBSOLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS.</speaker>
                  <p>But if the wealth it ſelfe were truly, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good, it would make him the better that poſſeſſeth it; but this (according vnto <hi>Seneca</hi>) it doth not, who ſayth, What auayleth vnto a Foole his wealth, ſince he becommeth thereby no whit the wiſer, nor the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>

                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>If it make him not the better, it may yet ſuffice, that it maketh him not the worſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>If you will beleeue the Philoſopher in his Rhetoricke, it maketh him alſo the worſe, ſeeing that it maketh men Proud, Iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15948:59"/> and Intemperate.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>He doth not meane, that it maketh all men ſo, but ſome men only: for if they be inclined vnto Vice, it may make them more vicious; as on the other ſide, if they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned vnto Vertue, it may make them more vertuous: and therfore it is to be accompted among thoſe externall good things, which help vnto humane felicity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>There can be nothing more repugnant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reaſon, then to make Wealth a part of humane felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſince on the other ſide, the ſame is rather held to be either an inſtrument, or a member of Iniquity. For ſo ſaith the Philoſopher in the Booke before mentioned, That rich men for the moſt part, are either Vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or the Heires vnto thoſe that haue been Vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as vnto ſome Extortioner, Deceiuer, Periurer, or the like. So as, if Wealth could make men happy, we might then conclude, that humane felicity were nothing els but the reward of Iniquity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>AQVILONIVS.</speaker>
                  <p>If Wealth may not make men happy, you may be ſure, that Pouerty may do it much leſſe; for if happines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Pouerty, then might we likewiſe ſay, that Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city were nothing els, but the reward of a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſquiet mynd, becauſe pouerty is accompanied with nothing more.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLANVS.</speaker>
                  <p>If we will belieue <hi>Arceſilaus,</hi> it is accompanied rather with Humility with Induſtry, and aboue all with Security; for that the rich, and not the poore be the Preyes vnto Pilferers, Robbers, and Manquellers. And to the end you may know, what Pouerty is accompanied with true Humility, you are to vnderſtand, that of Pouertyes there be two ſorts, the one, as I may ſay Vnuoluntary, being incurred, and ſuffered againſt a mans will; and the other Voluntary, being choſen and vndertaken of a mans
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15948:59"/> owne free election: of which the firſt is yrkſome and grieuous, yea many times vitious and ſinfull, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied which Enuy, vnlawfull Deſire of other mens goods, Fraud, and Deceipt, Pilfering, and Robbing, and ſometymes it cauſeth Murders and all kind of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and therfore is hatefull both to God and Man. The ſecond may be deuided into two ſorts; of the which the one may be termed Morall, and the other Religious, or Euangelicall. The Morall was practiſed by many of the old Philoſophers, who freely abandoned their wealth, and choſe to liue in pouerty, to auoyd the danger, and diſquiet of mynd, which commonly followeth Riches, as hath byn ſufficiently ſignified before. The Religious, or Euangelicall Pouerty being that only which is choſen and ſuffered for the pure Loue of God, was taught and practiſed by Chriſt our Sauiour himſelfe, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and hath him alwayes, and is ſtill profeſſed and practiſed in his Church by many of his ſeruants. And this ſort of Pouerty is that which is accompanyed with true Humility, Peace, Contentment, and heauenly Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and the Poore of this ſort are thoſe whome our Sauiour called <hi>B eſſed,</hi> and to whome he promiſed a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold in this life, and the Kingdome of Heauen in the next.</p>

                  <speaker>AQVILON.</speaker>
                  <p>If all men ſhould be poore, ſuch a Society would be like a body that were all head, or all legges, the which would not only be vnſeruiceable, but alſo deformed; and therfore Nature hauing ordained ſome men to be poore, &amp; ſome to be rich, it cannot well be ſaid that Wealth of it ſelfe is euill; or if by chance, it may ſeeme at any time to be euill, this is to be attributed ſtill vnto the euill mynd of him that euilly applyeth it, rather then to any thing els.</p>

                  <speaker>SVBSOLA.</speaker>
                  <p>Then if an euill man may apply his Wealth euilly, the euil applying therof may make an euill man the worſe.</p>

                  <speaker>AQVILON.</speaker>
                  <p>As touching this,

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SVBSOLA.</speaker>
                  <p>So that Wealth by the ſame reaſon may hurt a good man alſo, if he ſhould happen to apply it euilly.</p>

                  <speaker>SVBSOLA.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore when God retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a good man from waxing rich, it is not a ſigne of any hate he beareth him, but only that for his more good he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth him from a temptation, to become the worſe.</p>

                  <p>And ſo on the other ſide, when God doth ſuffer an euill man by any vnlawfull meanes to become very wealthy, it is not a ſigne of any loue he beareth him, but that only for his greater confuſion, he meaneth to let him runne the more irrecuperably vnto his owne perdition.</p>

                  <p>That is becauſe you be already out of tune, &amp; yet are loath to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it; but hearken to this other point which may happen to pleaſe you better, That when God doth finally ſuffer any good man by his owne good meanes, and induſtry, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich, it is a great ſigne that he giues him riches for his greater good, becauſe he foreſeeth that by applying of them well, he is to wynne great merit thereby.</p>

                  <p>Neuertheles before we end, I will by your leaue (according to my promiſe made you heretofore) debate with you, how all this your former doctrine, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſtandeth with diuine Authority: which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I hope you will reſt fully ſatisfied. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for as much as the diuers kinds of vnlawfull gaine (which you haue approued partly in priuate, and partly in publike perſons) may be all reduced, as I may ſay, to one Predicament of Fraud, or Deceyt practiſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15948:60"/> manners; we are to ponder and waygh the ſame in the iuſt and equall ballance, as well of the Law of Nature imprinted in euery mans hart, as alſo of the diuine Law written in the Holy Scriptures. Firſt then for the Law of Nature; Can any man be ſo voyd of naturall Reaſon as to doubt, whether all fraudulent Gaine be not flatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Law of Nature, which teacheth this knowne principle, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris?</hi> Therfore if no man would be content to be deceaued by other men, it followeth, that whoſoeuer ſeeketh to gaine by deceauing others, tranſgreſſeth the Law of Nature. Beſides that, man being ordeyned and borne not for himſelfe alone, but to liue in community and ciuill ſociety; it is euident that nothing is more contrary to the Common Wealth then Deceyt and Fraud, which being admitted would deſtroy all Traffique, and Commerce, and all Truſt and Confidence amongſt men, without the which there can be no Iuſtice, <hi>wherof Fidelity</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth very well in his <hi>Offices lib.</hi> 1.) <hi>is the foundation,</hi> and conſequently there could be no Common Wealth. In which reſpect <hi>Cicero</hi> alſo ſaith in the ſame place, That nothing doth more firmely vnite, and hold togeather the Common Wealth, then Fidelity, which therfore <hi>Valerius Maximus (lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.) calleth <hi>Venerabile Numen &amp;c.</hi> a Venerable and Diuine Power, and the moſt ſure Pledge of humane ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. And the <hi>Romans</hi> eſteemed it ſo much, that in the honour of it they buylt a Temple, wherein all Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and important Couenants were publikely made and ſworne, and he that afterwards did breake them, was deteſted of all men. Alſo man being made to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, who is Verity and Truth it ſelfe, ought alwayes to conſerue in himſelfe the ſimilitude and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, which likenes by fraud and deceyt he vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſeth, becomming the true Image of the Diuell,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15948:61"/> who is worthily called <hi>Diabolus,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>A Deceyuer,</hi> being, as our Sauiour tearmeth him (<hi>Ioan.</hi> 8.) <hi>Mendax, &amp; pater eius,</hi> a Lyar and the father of Lyes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no meruaile, that the written Law of God doth ſo much condemne deceytfull and fraudulent dealing, that it accompanieth and compareth the fraudulent man with the Bloud-ſucker, deteſting them both: <hi>Virum ſanguinum, &amp; doloſum</hi> (ſayth the Pſalmiſt) <hi>abhominatur Dominus.</hi> And therfore God alſo threatneth to puniſh them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like with vntimely death. <hi>Viri ſanguinum &amp; doloſi</hi> (ſaith the ſame Pſalmiſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54.) <hi>non dimidiabunt dies ſuos.</hi> And how deteſtable alſo in the ſight of God is all deceyt and the Deceyuer, the Holy Ghoſt ſignifieth, and inculcateth very often els where in the Holy Scripture ſaying (<hi>Prou.</hi> 1.) <hi>Euery Deceyuer is abhominable before God.</hi> And againe (<hi>cap.</hi> 8.) <hi>I deteſt the double-tongued man.</hi> And (<hi>cap.</hi> 20.) ſpeaking of a common cooſenage generally vſed alſo in theſe our dayes by falſe weyghts and meaſures, he ſayth: Weyght and Weyght, Meaſure and Meaſure is deteſtable in the ſight of God. Likewiſe the Prophet <hi>Micheas</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Iewes with deſtruction for their frauds, and deceyts (<hi>cap.</hi> 6.) <hi>As yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is fire in the houſe of the impious, treaſures of iniquity, and a leſſer meaſure full of wrath: why ſhall I iuſtify an impious ballance, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull weyght of the bagge, by which their rich men were repleniſhed with iniquity, and the Inhabitants therein ſpake lyes; and their tongue was fraudulent in their mouths, and therfore I began to ſtryke thee with perdition for thy ſinnes.</hi> Thus ſayd Almighty God by the mouth of his Prophet. And the like, yea a more terrible threat of eternall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is denounced by the Pſalmiſt to a deceytfull ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. Thou haſt loued (ſayth he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.) all words of precipitation, a deceytfull tongue; therefore God will deſtroy thee eternally: he will pluck thee vp, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15948:61"/> thee out of thy Tabernacle, and roote thee out of the Land of the liuing. Loe then how hatefull to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is all deceitfull and fraudulent dealing, be it by word, or act. And this being true in priuate perſons, what ſhall we thinke of fraud and deceit in Magiſtrates, Iudges, and publike Perſons? How abhominable is the ſame to God and Man, and pernicious not only to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealths which they gouerne, but alſo to themſelues through the ſeuerity of Gods Iuſtice and Iudgements v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them? In which reſpect King <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ordayned Iudges in the Cittyes of <hi>Iuda,</hi> ſaid vnto them (2. <hi>Par.</hi> 19.) <hi>Videte quid faciatis &amp;c.</hi> Looke well what you do, for you do not exerciſe the Iudgement of Man, but of God, and whatſoeuer you ſhall Iudge, ſhall redound to your ſelues. So he. And the hurt that redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Common wealth, by the iniuſtice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, doth not conſiſt only in the iniuryes done to the members therof, but alſo in the puniſhment that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth many times vpon the whole State for the ſinnes of the Heads, when the ſame are not puniſhed and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the offenders; ſuch being the ſeuerity of Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that when the Magiſtrats are either themſelues cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or els negligent in puniſhing the faults of others, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly impoſeth ſome generall penalty vpon the whole common Wealth, and many times deſtroyeth the ſame, or transferreth the gouerment therof to ſtranges, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſignifieth in <hi>Eccleſia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

So as if we duly conſider the enormity of Fraudes, Deceits, and of all kind of Iniuſtice, eſpecially in Magiſtrates, in whome the ſame commonly paſſeth without any humane puniſhment, we ſhall eaſily conclude the Fraudulent to be not only trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15948:62"/> to priuate men whome they deceaue and abuſe, but alſo trayterous to the common Wealth, by reaſon of the diuine Puniſhment which they draw vpon the ſame; beſides the eternall damnation which they purchaſe to themſelues for their owne offence therein if they do not repent, and do ſufficient ſatisfaction for it in this life; which Satisfaction neuertheleſſe cannot be done in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iniuſtice and Iniuryes without reſtitution of ill gotten goods, honour, and fame, according to the moſt Chriſtian and knowne axiome of <hi>S. Auguſtine: Non dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum.</hi> In which repſect the Publican <hi>Zachaeus,</hi> being by our Sauiour conuerted, and illuminated with the light of his Grace, did not content himſelfe to make a bare reſtitution of the iuſt valew only what he had wrongfully and fraudulently got, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to reſtore the quadruple, that is to ſay, foure times ſo much as he had guilfully &amp; vnlawfully gained of any man; alluding perhaps to the Law of <hi>Moyſes (Exod.</hi> 22.) where it was ordeyned, That in caſes of Theft, ſometimes the double, ſometimes the quadruple, yea &amp; otherwhiles fiue times ſo much as was ſtolne ſhould be reſtored. In which reſpect King <hi>Dauid</hi> ſwore to <hi>Nathan</hi> (2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 12.) that the rich man who had wrongfully taken a ſheep from a poore man, ſhould not only dye for it, but alſo reſtore the quadruple, for ſo indeed it was ordained in the Law. Now then this being ſo, it is to be conſidered, what he gayneth that enricheth himſelfe by Fraud and Deceyt, ſeeing that he looſeth not only his reputation (if it be knowne) but alſo his ſoule (how ſecretly ſoeuer he do it) in caſe he do not repent, and make Reſtitution of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull gaine, ſo farre as his ability will extend. Therfore, as I asked you before, whether you made accompt that your fraudulent rich man ſhould conſiſt of body only, or both of body and ſoule; ſo now I add thereto another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15948:62"/> to wit, whether you will haue him to be a beaſt, or a man? for if you accompt him for a man, that is to ſay, a reaſonable creature, we muſt exact of him to do the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a man, and not of a beaſt, to which purpoſe the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith, <hi>Nolite fieri ſicut equus &amp; mulus, quibus non eſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus;</hi> that is to ſay, be not lead, or moued chiefly by ſenſe and pleaſure, &amp; by the apprehenſion only of preſent obiects, as horſes, mules, and other beaſts are, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the due conſideration of future things, and of the end of euery thing, and eſpecially of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the eternall good of the ſoule, without which conſideration no man either is, or can be worthily accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therfore now to conclude, concerning all that Profit and Gaine which you haue hitherto placed in frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent meanes, it is moſt euident, that being preiudiciall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15948:63"/> and hurtful to the ſoule it cannot be accounted either gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or any way profitable, but moſt noyſome and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious according to our Sauiours expreſſe teſtimony, ſaying: <hi>Quid prodeſt homini, ſi vniuerſum mundum lucretur, animae verò ſuae detrimentum patiatur?</hi> wherupon it alſo followeth, that the Philoſophers Axiome is true, to wit, <hi>That nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable which is not honeſt</hi> (wherof I promiſed you before to giue you now a ſpeciall reaſon.) For ſeeing that all Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty whatſoeuer is hurtfull to the ſoule, it cannot poſſibly be profitable, no more then a pleaſant ſtong wine can be holſome in a hoat burning Feuer, which albeit for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeemeth to refreſh and comfort the ſick man, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turneth to his great domage: and euen ſo fareth it with all euill gotten gaine, which, though at firſt, and for a while contenteth the couetous mynd of the getter, yet in the end breedeth his euerlaſting torment, if, as I haue ſaid before, he doth not ſatisfy Gods Iuſtice by repentance, and reſtitution to his power. Therfore conſider now with your ſelfe, what reaſon you haue had in your former aſſertions, either to condemne good men ſo much as you haue done, for their Pouerty ariſing by honeſt Syncerity, or to extoll bad men ſo much aboue meaſure, for their riches growing by their fraudulent Practiſes, and other reproachfull Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quityes. The which is as much as occurreth heere to be ſaid, concerning the whole ſcope of vnlawfull Profit, generally conſidered.</p>
